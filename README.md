Team Project Description

Create an online catalog / shopping cart.

Data should come from a database that uses at least three tables and include at least 40 records (across all tables)

Users should be able to: 

           1) Filter the data retrieved using at least three fields 
                      (e.g., filtering movies by category or director)
           2) Sort the results using at least one field (asc,desc) 
           3) Click on a result item to get further information
           4) Add items to a shopping cart and display cart contents 
                      (you must use Session variables)

Your project should NOT insert, update, or delete records.
